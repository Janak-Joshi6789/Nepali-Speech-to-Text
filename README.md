# Nepali Speech-to-Text

A **7th Semester Computer Engineering Project** that converts **spoken Nepali audio into text** using machine learning and deep learning techniques.  
This project is designed to improve accessibility, support Nepali language processing, and contribute to the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in low-resource languages.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To develop a system that recognizes Nepali speech and transcribes it into text.  
- To experiment with state-of-the-art models (e.g., Wav2Vec2, DeepSpeech).  
- To create a dataset of Nepali speech and evaluate model performance.  
- To make the system usable for real-world applications (voice typing, assistive tools, transcription).

---

## 🚀 Features
- Converts Nepali audio (.wav/.mp3) into text.  
- Supports Unicode Nepali text output.  
- Works on short and long audio samples.  
- Extensible for mobile or web-based integration.

📊 Dataset

Due to large size, dataset files are not included in this repository.
We collected Nepali speech data and paired them with text transcriptions.
👉 You can download the dataset from [Google Drive / Kaggle / Hugging Face] (link to be provided).
